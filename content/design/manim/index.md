excerpt: ManimCE is a Python library that allows for the creation of math animations. Originally developed by Grant Sanderson of [3Blue1Brown](3blue1brown.com) and then transformed by a dedicated community into a more accessible tool, ManimCE can be used to create short animations for use in presentations, full-length explainer videos, and everything in between.
