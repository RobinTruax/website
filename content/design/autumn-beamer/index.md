## Autumn is a minimalist Beamer theme in red, green, and brown.

`autumn` is a clean Beamer theme with the same color scheme as my website: deep reds, dry greens, and rich browns. Avoiding gradients and complicated periphery, the theme relies on clean lines and serif headers to distinguish itself. It is my personal ideal Beamer theme, but if you like it, you're welcome to it.

Download the theme and an example presentation [here](https://github.com/RobinTruax/autumn). To use the theme, simply include all four style files in your project, and run `\usetheme{autumn}`.
