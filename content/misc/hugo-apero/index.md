[Hugo Apéro](https://github.com/hugo-apero/) is the theme I used to create this website. It's easily customizable and requires little-to-no programming experience; a day of trial-and-error following the ''Get Started'' series was enough to get the hang of the essential operations. There's not much to say beyond "follow the get started page, it's excellent". Even the "animation" I created for the main page is just a GIF that I made (using ManimCE) in the usual spot for the image. If I can recommend anything, it would be to take a look at the example personal websites available [here](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app/project/) and steal elements (colors, sections, design pieces) that you enjoy, as the code for all of them can usually be easily found on their Github.
