excerpt: This image depicts the Julia set (that is, the set of initial values which remain bounded under iteration) of a holomorphic extension of the Collatz function (which is initially defined on any positive integers *n* to divide *n* by 2 if *n* is even and multiply *n* by 3 and add 1 otherwise). This results in a fractal representing the complexity of the Collatz Conjecture.

This section contains the code and images I created depicting the Julia set of a holomorphic extension of the Collatz function. Essentially, the way this works is that I took a holomorphic extension of the Collatz function (which is initially defined on any positive integers *n* to divide *n* by 2 if *n* is even and multiply *n* by 3 and add 1 otherwise). This extended function is given by the following formula:

Then, this fractal is given by taking a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set">Julia set</a> of this function. A link to the code is <a href="collatz_generator.py" target="_blank">here</a>.
