excerpt: "Chip-firing is a model in dynamical combinatorics in which chips are passed back and forth along the edges of a graph. In this model, one can construct the ''sandpile group'' of a graph; this group's identities have a beautiful fractal-esque structure which can be visualized for certain types of graphs."
