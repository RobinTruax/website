excerpt: "In this piece, there is a grid of pixels, each one with color representing one of rock, paper, or scissors. When pixels are mostly surrounded by a color beating their color, they switch (so rock mostly surrounded by paper becomes paper, for example). The system evolves but never settles, as waves of rock, paper, and scissors cross the screen. With the right color choices, the result is striking."
