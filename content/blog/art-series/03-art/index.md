excerpt: This image depicts the Julia set (that is, the set of initial values which remain bounded under iteration) of a holomorphic extension of the Collatz function (which is initially defined on any positive integers *n* to divide *n* by 2 if *n* is even and multiply *n* by 3 and add 1 otherwise). This results in a fractal representing the complexity of the Collatz Conjecture.
