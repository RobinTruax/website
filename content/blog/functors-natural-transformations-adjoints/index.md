excerpt: This post focuses on a construction in category theory that I personally found particularly confusing; the notion of adjoint functors. Part of the confusion stems from the fact that there are 3 seemingly different definitions for what an adjoint is, and the process of grappling with these definitions and showing they are equivalent is often skipped in classes which use them, like Math 210 or 216. This post discusses in full detail all three definitions and examples showing why choosing the right definition can substantially shorten proofs.
