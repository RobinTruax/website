excerpt: "This post is of the notes from a talk I gave on an application of the probabilistic method to problems in algebra: the problem of being given a subset *S* of a finite abelian group *A*, and trying to find the largest subset *T* of *S* which is \"sum-free\". Here, we give a bound on the size of *T* in terms of *S*, and show that it is tight."
