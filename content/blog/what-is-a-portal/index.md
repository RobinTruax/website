excerpt: "When a mathematician is asked why they enjoy math, they are as likely to comment about math's intrinsic beauty or artistic elements as they are to mention its usefulness or ubiquity in science. However, it is more difficult to express to non-mathematicians why a particular idea or proof is beautiful than why it is useful, and so the gap between mathematicians and non-mathematicians on why math is alluring persists. Mathematical beauty means something different to each person: in this post, I express what it means to me."
