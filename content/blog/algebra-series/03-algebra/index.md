excerpt: This post discusses applications of group theory to problems in topology. It starts by defining paths and homotopies between them, then works towards a full description of the fundamental group - not just as a construction, but as a functor, and the power of that perspective. The post has plenty of drawings and examples, which is critical for this type of math. This is animed at students in the middle of a first course in algebra who want to see how the subject is used in other, more "natural" areas of math.
