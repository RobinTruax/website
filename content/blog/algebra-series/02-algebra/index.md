excerpt: This post discusses applications of group theory to number theory problems. It starts with ring theory (UFDs, PIDs, and Euclidean Domains) and moves on to sums of squares, a related Diophantine equation, and an example elliptic curve solvable with Fermat Factorization. This is aimed at students finishing a first course in algebra who want to see how the subject is used in other, more "natural" areas of math.
