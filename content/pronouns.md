To elaborate, I identify as nonbinary. As such, I strongly prefer the pronouns they/them, and am very appreciative of those who take the initiative to use them. However, I include "he" as preemptive forgiveness for mistakes (both those made before and those made after I make my preference known). My journey has illustrated how strong the bounds of language are, and I know habits are hard to break. I trust most people to be kind, and will only (gently) correct those who repeatedly use "he".
