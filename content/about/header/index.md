  Hello, and welcome in.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
My name is Roshan, but I go by Robin to all but my closest friends. I am a student at Stanford University focusing on mathematics (especially algebra, combinatorics, and complexity theory), political theory (especially the politics of epistemology and formal theory), and art (film photography). I will be graduating in Spring 2024 with a BS in Mathematics, a BA in Political Science, a minor in Art Practice, and an MS in Computer Science. 

My mathematical [research](/papers/) engages with a wide range of subjects, including topology, combinatorics, representation theory and group theory. Outside of pure math, I study social choice theory in political science and complexity theory in computer science. 

Broadly, my goal is to develop connections -- what I call [portals](/blog/what-is-a-portal/) -- between disparate fields, both between different types of math and between math and other fields (including art!). I am also a writer and speaker on math education, and am passionate about achieving [epistemic justice](/blog/epistemic-justice/) for marginalized groups in math. My email is truax [at] stanford [dot] edu.
