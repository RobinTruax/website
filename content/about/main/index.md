  ### What am I up to?
  Last summer, I studied combinatorial properties of certain hyperplane arrangements at the [Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM)](https://icerm.brown.edu/summerug/2022/). Afterwards, I returned to Stanford for my third year, where I am continuing my schoolwork, research, and art.
  ### What do I enjoy?
  I have lived all over the United States, but I consider my "hometown" to be Seattle, where I lived the longest. I love reading, particularly where Asian-American literature meets science fiction and magical realism (see [Ted Chiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation:_Stories) or [Ken Liu](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24885533-the-paper-menagerie-and-other-stories)), as well as modernist and queer literature. I enjoy art, particularly writing, photography, knitting, and woodworking. I also enjoy playing games, both tabletop games and video games (most recently [Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/)). My favorite genres of music are R&B (ex. [Emawk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ne7tLBvNaw) or [grentperez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsH_ZW6CYsw)), alternative (ex. [Mitski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4J3Z9xgjWQ), [Hozier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlLx7oE7q3I), [Arctic Monkeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrmPDUvKyLs), or [TV Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-7hMD2OgBc)).
