  ### What am I up to?
  This summer, I am studying combinatorial properties of certain hyperplane arrangements at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM). Afterwards, I shall be returning to Stanford for my third year, where I will continue my research on the mathematics of voting systems while completing my studies.
  ### What do I enjoy?
  I have lived all over the United States, but I consider my "hometown" to be Seattle, where I lived the longest. I love reading, particularly where Asian-American and queer literature meets science fiction and magical realism (see Ted Chiang or Ken Liu). I also enjoy playing games, both tabletop games and video games (most recently [Celeste]()). My favorite genres of music are R&B (ex. Emawk or grentperez) and alternative (ex. Mitski or Of Montreal). Reach out to me if we have any interests in common: my email is truax [at] stanford [dot] edu.
