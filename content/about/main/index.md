  ### What am I up to?
  This summer, I am studying combinatorial properties of certain hyperplane arrangements at the [Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM)](https://icerm.brown.edu/summerug/2022/). Afterwards, I shall be returning to Stanford for my third year, where I will continue my research on the mathematics of voting systems while completing my studies.
  ### What do I enjoy?
  I have lived all over the United States, but I consider my "hometown" to be Seattle, where I lived the longest. I love reading, particularly where Asian-American and queer literature meets science fiction and magical realism (see [Ted Chiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation:_Stories) or [Ken Liu](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24885533-the-paper-menagerie-and-other-stories)). I also enjoy playing games, both tabletop games and video games (most recently [Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/)). My favorite genres of music are R&B (ex. [Emawk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ne7tLBvNaw) or [grentperez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsH_ZW6CYsw)) and alternative (ex. [Mitski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4J3Z9xgjWQ) or [of Montreal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3RAI8Ntamw)). Reach out to me if we have any interests in common: my email is truax [at] stanford [dot] edu.
