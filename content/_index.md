description: "I am a student of <a href='blog/what-is-a-portal/'>mathematics</a>, political theory, and the theory of computation. My research is primarily in combinatorics and algebra, but I am also interested in questions in applied math using these tools, such as the game theory of voting systems and various complexity-theoretic questions. Finally, I work to create aesthetically beautiful and technologically effective tools for sharing math. My CV is <a href='about/cv.pdf'>here</a>."
