      <description>Epistemology
Epistemology refers to the study of knowledge: what qualifies as “knowledge”, what types of knowledge exist, and ways that knowledge can be gained. A popular conception of epistemology casts it as theoretical, even philosophically reclusive. After all, the most famous argument for what we can “know” is solipsism: the idea that input to our senses can be fabricates, and the only thing which we cannot doubt is our own existence, for the very act of doubting proves that cognition (and therefore our consciousness) exists.</description>

      <title>What is a &#34;Portal&#34;? (Why Math is Beautiful)</title>

      <description>Many people have tried and failed to communicate how mathematicians feel about math. When someone asks a pure mathematician why they enjoy math, the mathematician will likely comment about math&#39;s intrinsic beauty, or how it is art as much as science. This is true: pure mathematicians, by and large, are motivated by curiousity and an artistic perspective. However, it&#39;s more difficult to express why a particular theorem is beautiful than to argue why it is useful, and so many people still don&#39;t understand why math is so alluring to its practitioners.</description>
